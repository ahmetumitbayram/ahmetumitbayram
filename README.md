### Hi there 👋

👨‍💻 I am Ahmet Ümit. I am 31 years old and I work as a Security Engineer at Akinon.

💀 Currently, I am focusing on binary exploitation and conducting Bug Bounty programs and vulnerability research.

❓ You can ask me questions about web application security, Bug Bounty, and Vulnerability Research.

⌨️ In my profile, you can find some of the exploits I have developed, the ones I have coded with Django, and the tools and modules I have written in Python and Go.
